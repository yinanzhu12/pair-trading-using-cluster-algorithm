This project carry out follow-ups on some of the ideas in

https://www.quantopian.com/posts/pairs-trading-with-machine-learning

The questions I want to addressed here which were not or not fully considered in above materials are:

1) Propose different ways to turn stock prices data into phase space where you carry out clustering and compare them
2) Discuss how long and how much one can trust such pairs in out-of-sample tests
3) Possibility to construct a strategy which can automatically cure the failures in out-of sample tests
